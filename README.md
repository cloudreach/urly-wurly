# Urly Wurly is an URL shortener build on GCP Cloud Run

It is currently available [here](https://urly-wurly-oyehxjlgwa-uc.a.run.app)

## I wanna try it!

Sure! You'll need an authenticated GCP login, Cloud Run service enabled and beta tools install for `gcloud`.

```bash
make storage build deploy
```
